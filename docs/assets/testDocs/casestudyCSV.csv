Research by Professor Robert Garner on the ethics and politics of animal protection has provided a springboard for political debate and decision making both in the UK and internationally. In particular, Garner's work has impacted upon the debate within the animal protection movement, and has helped to shape aspects of government policy on animal welfare issues in general, most notably on the UK Government's approach to the issue of whaling, and DEFRA's approach to the ethics of using wild animals in circuses.","The debate about the human treatment of animals contains a bewildering array of normative, strategic, and scientific claims. The starting point for Garner's research is, as one reviewer put it, to `lead the way through this labyrinth of moral mazes, political inconsistencies and economic sticking points clearly and analytically'.

This research has been undertaken by Garner primarily since 1995 when he joined the University of Leicester, first as a Lecturer and subsequently in the role of Reader and latterly Professor.

In particular, two strands underpin the impact of Garner's research on the nature of animal protection as a political issue, and the ethics of our use of animals:

(i) The development of a typology of positions in the animal ethics debate and the advocacy of a particular, rights-based, ethic.

(ii) The advocacy of a particular strategic position known as New Welfarism or Animal Protectionism

In terms of (i) Garner has sought to delineate and explore the consequence, for the treatment of animals, of the adoption of different positions within the animal ethics debate (1, 2). Of particular importance has been the distinction made between animal welfare as a scientific endeavour and as an ethic (4, chapter 5). This expertise was utilised, for instance, by the DEFRA/WSPA workshop on Animal Welfare and Whaling and by other bodies (see below) who have proffered invites to talk at conferences and meetings.

In terms of (ii) Garner is the leading advocate of a strategic position (New Welfarism or Animal Protectionism) which combines a consideration of ethics and political possibility (1, 3, 4). It seeks to challenge, both strategically and philosophically, the claims of the so-called animal rights absolutists who advocate the abolition of particular uses of animals on the grounds that to use them, irrespective of what is done to them whilst they are being used, is illegitimate morally. Animal protectionism, by contrast, argues, strategically, for incremental change in pursuit of non-human animal interests. It is a position that agrees (with abolitionists) that the animal welfare model of animal protection—whereby animals may be used as food, clothing, entertainment and in experiments so long as there is no unnecessary suffering—is flawed ethically. However, it also suggests that the incremental approach stressing the need to eradicate unnecessary suffering may still have some political mileage.

Garner argues that the pursuit of better treatment of animals through incremental change is consistent with holding an abolitionist ideology, and rejects the critics (notably Professor Gary Francione, an American legal scholar) who argue that reforms that improve the treatment of animals persuade the public that the animals they use are being treated kindly, and that continued use is therefore justifiable (3).

Ethically, Garner argues that both the animal welfare and the abolitionist animal rights position are flawed. Rather, an approach that is based on the right of animals not to suffer is closer to the correct normative position, and this could, possibly, be consistent with the continued use of animals as a source of food and as subjects of scientific experiments."," Garner, R., Animals, Politics and Morality (Manchester University Press, second edition, 2004, 296 pp.)."

They showed that the advertising of infant formula and follow-on formula had changed since the change in regulations in 2007. Prevalence of information about product features increased from 2006 to 2008-09 in print advertisements while there was evidence that TV advertising of follow-on formula and its intended use had become less clear. After the change in regulations, TV advertisements were more likely to use techniques designed to play on the emotions of consumers than print advertisements; the use of emotional triggers becoming more prevalent. The text in print and TV advertisements had become easier to read but techniques that could further improve clarity reported by the research team had not been utilised either before or after the change in regulations. There was evidence that in TV advertising of follow-on formula there had been a decline in the use of images showing age-related factors that may indicate to consumers the suitability of follow-on formula products."," October 2008 — July 2009: Gunter, B and Dickinson, R.

Since 2009, Moore's research has developed quantitative and qualitative framework modelling that can be applied through a project, from design-brief stage to end-user deployment.

His research analysed measurements and sustainability accreditation assessments of developments in Australia, China, Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Bali, and India. Exemplar projects include the Rise Noosa and Salt precincts in Australia, Alila Resorts at Uluwatu and Soori Bali in Indonesia, Hilton Hadahaa Island in the Maldives, and Banyan Tree's Laguna Lang Company, in Vietnam. During the developmental research, the Precinct Planning Design Standard (PPDS) was used as a sustainability modelling tool for the Australian State Government regulated, ecologically sensitive, United Nation biosphere area at Lake Weyba Noosa on the Sunshine Coast of Queensland Australia. PPDS provided greater certainty regarding predicted long term ecological performance improvements on this high profile ecologically sensitive project.

Moore (2010b) identified an early research focus on a process-based framework for delivering sustainable development for travel and tourism infrastructure in coastal, rural, or urban regions. He reviewed environmental, social and economic policy and strategies being pursued by international, national, state, region and local level and how they translate into the regulatory and development process. He also analysed existing statutory regulation and its integration of sustainable principles into the development approval process. Additionally, his research reviews and critiques existing sustainable models and tools and how they interface with the regulatory process. Linking the proposed performance based integrated process framework and its models and tools to the development approval process, Moore determined the barriers to the implementation of sustainable principles on medium to large mixed use precinct developments. Through case studies, Moore tested the framework, models and tools using several medium to large mixed use precinct developments to determine how good intent translates to actual performance.

The framework developed into the fully integrated PPDS tool incorporating planning and design, construction management, and facility operations. It integrates the development process with ecological assessments for medium to large mixed-use precincts in one management tool. This helps clients, stakeholders and professional advisors, particularly the development manager, achieve goals brought on by ever-increasing sustainability demands and delivery pressures. PPDS meets industry demands to mitigate ecological impact.

Moore (2011) shows that existing development standards and tools adopt principles that define sustainable planning, design, and construction, but have only limited references to pre-development and operational needs. PPDS, however, (Moore, 2012) gives full regard to post-construction management and performance measurement. These two major omissions, pre-PPDS, indicate deficiencies in key standards such as the sustainability protocols existing as the Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) (UK), the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) (United States of America) and GreenStar (Australia). Sustainability principles were rarely initial or ultimate project objectives; projects merely responded to statutory authority requirements and only included environmental imperatives. Furthermore, earlier standards are limited by their assumptions about pre-determined site choice: the PPDS development tool incorporates early pre-planning and design phases of the development process. The development industry commonly separates construction and management (Moore, 2010a) leading to many of the industry's delivery problems such as poor quality, over-spend and poor programmed performance. Whilst pre-PPDS standards follow and perpetuate this unsatisfactory disconnection, PPDS provides a fully integrated design-brief to end-user approach. The Unit's on-going research, further refining the PPDS, explores how to disseminate the benefits of the framework approach into industry process and practice. This includes mechanisms by which institutional, social and regulatory barriers are overcome.

Initial research was funded in 2006 by the Australian Government and Earthcheck Pty at the University of Queensland, where Moore was then employed. Since joining Anglia Ruskin University as Senior Lecturer in 2009 he has extended and expanded this research within the submitting Unit.",The following publications have been peer reviewed and published internationally.
